# How can we use Play Calling to Increase Passing Efficiency - NFL Data Project
@AustinCEason<br>
# Introduction
In this project, I will attempt to determine whether I can use 2025 NFL data from the nfl_data_py library to identify which plays or play features increase passing efficiency. The main modules from nfl_data_py I am using are pbp_data, ftn_data, and team_desc. <br>
pbp_data contains core information about every snap from the season, such as what happened, when it happened, and who was involved. It also contains some advanced stats like EPA, which is one of my personal favorites for evaluating efficiency. ftn_data is a collection of snap data that goes more in-depth about player positioning and offensive play type. Finally, team_desc contains links to team logos that are used to make visuals. <br>
